# 2019 Scottish Open Data List

## Important Note - August 2020
The contents of the file below is frozen as of March 2019. 

If you are looking for an updated survey of Scottish open data please check the [main Readme](https://github.com/watty62/SOD/blob/master/README.md) of this repo. 

## News
11 Mar 2019
Added open procurement and open contracts links below. Hard to find, but these pages do offer good data coverage and are clearly licensed under OGL 3.0

27 Feb 2019
Two new sources identified. 

* Scottish Parliament with 121 Datasets, and 
* Health and Social Care (Home Care) Datasets

The licensing for each of these is far from clear or easy to understand, but having waded through it I believe that the Scottish Government's intent is that they are licensed under OGL or similar. 

## The Data
A list of open data resources in the Scottish public sector. 

Data is broken into two types - open data, and linked open data.

| Key     | Definition |
| :------ |:-----------| 
|A|API|
|L|Linked Open Data|
|O|Open Data|

------

## Local Authorities
Data provided by the 32 Local Authorities. The data provision falls into three formats: portal, landing page and GIS-only data. 

### Open Data Portals

The following councils have open data portals - most, if not all, CKAN. 

| Council       | URL         | Status| Datasets | +/- since last time| Type |

### Landing Pages 

The following councils have open landing pages as part of their websites.

### Using GIS only

These councils only expose geographical open data using their GIS systems.

### None of the above
The following authorities still have no open data provision that I can find. 

- East Dunbartonshire Council
- East Lothian Council
- Falkirk Council
- Fife Council
- Inverclyde Council
- Midlothian Council
- Orkney Islands Council

## Scottish Parliament
The Scottish Parliament, separate to the Scottish Government has released 121 data sets. This covers motions, petitions, Bills, petitions and other procedural data, and is very interesting.

The licensing is far from clear. To find that you have to go to Notes > Policy on Use of SPCB Copyright Material. Following the first link there you see that you have to add "Contains information licenced under the Scottish Parliament Copyright Licence. " to anything you make with it, which is OK. But if you go to the second link the wording (slightly) contradicts that obligation. It then has a chunk about OGL but says, "This Scottish Parliament Licence is aligned with OGLv3.0" whatever that means. Why not just license all of the data under OGL? I can't see what they are trying to do. 

[Scottish Parliament Open Data](https://data.parliament.scot/#/datasets)

Bob Taylor has created some interesting visualisations with this data [here](https://github.com/jakeybob/opendata-gganimate-test)

## Scottish Government
The sections below list open data provision by the Scottish Government and its directorates, agencies, NDPBS etc. Locating data is not helped by the antiquated Scottish Government website. Searching tends to throw up policy pages rather than data. Thankfully they are testing a beta version website. While that looks much better it breaks many of the links. 

### Main Scottish Government Statisttics Portal
The Scottish Government's Statistics have a great portal with 248 Data Sets from multiple organisational-providers.

 - [The Scottish Spatial Data Infrastructure](http://spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home). This is a metadata repository for Inspire data, but does not publish open data.
- Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation: [map](http://simd.scot/2016/#/simd2016/BTTTFTT/9/-4.0000/55.9000/) and Data is on the Statistics Portal mentioned above, specifically[here](https://statistics.gov.scot/data/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2016)
 - [Spatial Hub](http://www.spatialhub.scot/get-data/) - 4 datasets open

### Scottish Government Directorates
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorates_of_the_Scottish_Government) there are thirty-three directorates of the Scottish Government. These are listed below. So far it appears that few produce open data.

#### Scottish Exchequer Directorates
No open data found.

- Financial Strategy
- Internal Audit

#### Education, Communities and Justice Directorates
No open data found.

- Advanced Learning and Science
- Housing and Social Justice
- Justice
- Learning
- Local Government and Communities
- Safer Communities

#### Health and Social Care Directorates

There are three datasets about homecare made available [here](https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Health/Data/HomeCare/HSC-Datasets-HCPRF). It took someone who knows about this to find them and let me know about their existence. This is on the old Scots Government Website. The new one is [here](https://www.gov.scot/).

The main page is clearly marked at, the foot, "Crown Copyright." However, clicking on that take us to [this page](https://www2.gov.scot/CrownCopyright) which is something I have not seen before on the Scottish Government website. "Re-using Crown copyright material. You may use and re-use the information featured on this website (not including logos) free of charge in any format or medium, under the terms of the Open Government Licence." This is fantastic, and something that I have been calling for for some time across the Scottish public sector. The new website allows the same reuse of content under OGL. 


- Chief Medical Officer
- Chief Nursing Officer
- Children and Families
- Health and Social Care Integration
- Healthcare Quality and Improvement
- Health Finance
- Health Performance and Delivery
- Health Workforce & Strategic Change
- Population Health

#### Economy Directorates

So far I have identified Marine Scotland as the only body in the list below publishing Open Data.

| Directorate   | URL         | Datasets |Change| Type|
| :------------- |:-------------| :-----:|:---:|:---:|
|Marine Scotland Data|[https://data.marine.gov.scot](https://data.marine.gov.scot)|210| -66|OA|
|Marine Scotland Maps|[http://maps.marine.gov.scot](http://data.marine.gov.scot)|972 ^|- |(O)|
|Marine Scotland Information|[http://marine.gov.scot](http://marine.gov.scot)|300$||O|

^ The layers aren't all #opendata but there are 972 live layers on MS Maps (805 of those are available as WMS). 244 of the layers have a download link. 43 of those datasets are provided for download under OGL via SSDI. Those specific 43 layers are Marine Scotland data, plus there is an additional 2 on a view only service. Source: https://twitter.com/marinemaps/status/1098275087973797890

$ - 300 information pages available as web page, rss, or xml (with linkages to other Marine Scotland platforms)

- Agriculture and Rural Economy

- Economic Development
- Energy & Climate Change
- Environment & Forestry
- Fair Work, Employability & Skills
- _Marine Scotland_ (including Aquaculture, Freshwater Fisheries & Licensing Policy, Performance, Science, Planning & Policy, Compliance and Sea Fisheries Policy)

#### Organisational Development and Operations Directorates

The Scottish Government supports Open Procurement. You can download bulk notices or use the API to select data. 
You can find the data [here](https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/NoticeDownload/Download.aspx)

Similarly, you can search the contracts register [on this page](https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/Contracts/Contracts_Search.aspx?AuthID=AA10482). Each is OGL licensed. 

- Communications and Ministerial Support
- Digital
- Financial Management
- People
- Scottish Procurement and Commercial

#### Constitution and External Affairs Directorates
No open data found. 

- External Affairs
- Legal Services (Solicitor to the Scottish Government)

### Scottish Government Executive Agencies
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_agencies_of_the_Scottish_Government) lists nine executive agencies.
Where the items in the list below are starred, it indicates that they have some or all of their open data on the Statistics portal, above. Otherwise, I have found no open data for them. Compare this with [Wikidata items](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17576433) which are CC0 licensed Linked Data and carry HES identifiers for the objects, as well as categories of teh listed buildings. 

- Accountant in Bankruptcy __*__
- Disclosure Scotland
- Education Scotland
- Historic Environment Scotland
- Scottish Prison Service
- Scottish Public Pensions Agency
- Social Security Scotland
- Student Awards Agency for Scotland
- Transport Scotland

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_bodies_of_the_Scottish_Government), the Scottish Government is reponsible for the following 92 Non Departmental Public Bodies, each of whom should be producing open data according to the Scottish Government's Open Data. 

#### Scottish Government non-ministerial government departments
Where the items in the list below are starred, it indicates that they have some or all of their open data on the Statistics portal, above. Otherwise, I have found no open data for them.

- Registers of Scotland
- Revenue Scotland __*__

The Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator does allow a download of data, but the conditions attached to it means that it is not strictly Open Data. See: [https://www.oscr.org.uk/about-charities/search-the-register/charity-register-download](https://www.oscr.org.uk/about-charities/search-the-register/charity-register-download)

#### Executive NDPBs

Where the items in the list below are starred, it indicates that they have some or all of their open data on the Statistics portal, above. Otherwise, I have found no open data for them.
