## News
August 2020
- The NHS Scotland Open Data platform continues to be developed as a very useful resource. 
- None of the fourteen Health Boards publish their own open data, and 
- only one of the thirty Health and Social Care Partnerships (HSCPs) publish anything resembing open data: Angus HSCP. 


### NHS Scotland  
In addition to the data below, NHS Scotland Information Services Division they have some open data on the Statistics portal which is covered on the review of [Scottish Government](Scottish_Government.md). 


There is an open data portal which is developing well, with a growing list of useful datasets.

### Scottish Health Boards
There are currently fourteen Health Boards in Scotland. Looking beyond anything which may appear in the portal above, I found no open data published by any of the fourteen. Some performance data (e.g. Waiting Times) is presented nationally in the portal above. 

- NHS Ayrshire and Arran
- NHS Borders
- NHS Dumfries and Galloway	
- NHS Western Isles
- NHS Fife
- NHS Forth Valley
- NHS Grampian
- NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde
- NHS Highland
- NHS Lanarkshire
- NHS Lothian
- NHS Orkney
- NHS Shetland
- NHS Tayside

Two health Boards, Borders and Tayside each have Publication Schemes which state "Class 9 - Open Data: We do not publish any information in this class." My understanding is that each have a legal duty to produce a publication scheme, but it is possible the others do so but are silent on Open Data, and therefore not picked up by my search. 

The Urban Big Data Centre, already covered under [HE](FE.md), publish [one aggregate dataset](http://ubdc.gla.ac.uk/group/71ddf317-ea04-4236-8453-cdefda557d1a?organization=nhs-ggc-safe-haven) for Greater Glasgow and Clyde. 

### Scottish Joint Health and Social Care Partnerships
There are 30 Health and Social Care Partnerships (HSCPs) in Scotland. 

Other than Angus HSCP no open data was found for any Partnership. 

- Aberdeen City HSCP
- Aberdeenshire HSCP
- Angus HSCP (__Angus___
- Argyll and Bute HSCP
- City of Edinburgh HSCP
- Clackmannanshire and Stirling HSCP
- Dumfries and Galloway HSCP
- Dundee City HSCP
- East Ayrshire HSCP
- East Dunbartonshire HSCP
- East Lothian HSCP
- East Renfrewshire HSCP
- Falkirk HSCP
- Fife HSCP
- Glasgow City HSCP
- Highland HSCP
- Inverclyde HSCP
- Midlothian HSCP
- Moray HSCP
- North Ayrshire HSCP
- North Lanarkshire HSCP
- Orkney HSCP
- Perth and Kinross HSCP
- Renfrewshire HSCP
- Scottish Borders HSCP
- Shetland Islands HSCP
- South Ayrshire HSCP
- South Lanarkshire HSCP
- West Dunbartonshire HSCP
- West Lothian HSCP
- Western Isles (Comhairle nan Eilean Siar) HSCP

__Angus__ This partnership publishes a list of [nine maps](https://www.angushscp.scot/mapping/) on their HSCP's mapping platform, making them stand apart from the other 29! It states "Below is a list of maps which are available to view / download. The datasets for these maps will be available via the partnerships (sic) Open Data platform." There is no link to such an OD platform, and licensing of these maps is unclear. They do, however, make nice use of Open Streetmap to dislpay the map data. 

Interestingly West Dunbartonshire have a [publication scheme](http://wdhscp.org.uk/media/1884/wdhscp-board-publication-scheme-oct-17.pdf) which states: 

> "While West Dunbartonshire Health & Social Care Partnership Board does not itself hold open data sets and their metadata (as these are held by the Council and the Health Board) performance information is routinely published: [http://wdhscp.org.uk/about-us/public-reporting/](http://wdhscp.org.uk/about-us/public-reporting/) " 

This takes us, inter alia, to [this report](http://wdhscp.org.uk/media/2326/wdhscp-quarterly-performance-report-qtrs-3-and-4-2019-20.pdf) which is jammed with performance data that would be really useful as open data, were it not bound up in tables and charts in a PDF!
