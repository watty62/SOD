## Scottish Government
The sections below list open data provision by the Scottish Government and its directorates, agencies, NDPBS etc. The challenges identified around findability in the Feb 2019 review are little changed. 

## News
__Review underway February / March 2020. A work in progress__

There is still an issue with finability of data, with no central portal for open data in the Scottish public sector or even for Scottish Government. Searching the [main Scottish Government website](https://www.gov.scot/) for _open data_ yields 633 results, none of which are links to _data_ on the first four screenfuls, I didn't go deeper than that.  

## The Data
A list of open data resources in the Scottish Government. 

Data is broken into three types - APIs, open data, and linked open data.

| Key     | Definition |
| :------ |:-----------| 
|A|API|
|L|Linked Open Data|
|O|Open Data|

## Main Scottish Government Statisttics Portal
The Scottish Government's Statistics have a very good portal with 286 Data Sets from multiple organisational-providers. This is up by 38 datasets on last year and includes a new organisation: The Care Inspectorate. 

I've heard numerous comments from people who find the interface challenging but there are some very helpful [guides provided](https://guides.statistics.gov.scot).

 - [The Scottish Spatial Data Infrastructure](http://spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home). This is a metadata repository for Inspire data, but does not publish open data.
- Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation: [map](http://simd.scot/2016/#/simd2016/BTTTFTT/9/-4.0000/55.9000/) and Data is on the Statistics Portal mentioned above, specifically[here](https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdata%2Fscottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation)
 - [Spatial Hub](http://www.spatialhub.scot/get-data/) - still has 4 open datasets; __no change on 2019__. And it still has the most annoying pop-up in the whole of the public sector!

## Scottish Government Directorates
According to [this page](https://www.gov.scot/about/how-government-is-run/directorates/) there are forty-three directorates of the Scottish Government, up from thirty-three at the start of 2019. These are listed below. So far it appears that few produce open data. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorates_of_the_Scottish_Government), which counts 42 directorates, groups these into Directorates-General but this grouping is not obvious from the SG site. 

Incidentally, why isn't there Linked Open Data published about the structure of the Scottish Government with unique identifiers and permanent URIs for each? 

Addtitionally, when accessing the 166 Scottish Government data sets (see the URL in the table above), below the Explore bar there are links (depending on the dataset) to various 'concept folders' such as [housing](https://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fdef%2Fconcept%2Ffolders%2Fthemes%2Fhousing) many of which must surely align with some of the list below (e.g. Housing and Social Justice Directorate) but unpicking which have published Open Data and which have not appears almost impossible at the moment.

### Homecare 
There are three old datasets about homecare (2010-2012) made available [here](https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Health/Data/HomeCare/HSC-Datasets-HCPRF). It took someone who knows about this to find them and let me know about their existence. This is on the old Scottishs Government Website. The new one is [here](https://www.gov.scot/).

The main page is clearly marked at, the foot, "Crown Copyright." However, clicking on that take us to [this page](https://www2.gov.scot/CrownCopyright). "Re-using Crown copyright material. You may use and re-use the information featured on this website (not including logos) free of charge in any format or medium, under the terms of the Open Government Licence."

$ 240 datasets with 768 downloadable resources. API to query csv resources (315 resources), as well as DCAT standard inventory on data.marine.gov.scot/data.json

~ New this year is 131 marine license pages with access to 2443 license documents. Also around 2,000 links to other organisations, reports etc.

£ There are currently 1,109 spatial layers listed. These originate from many different organisations and licenses though.

### Procurement
The Scottish Government supports Open Procurement. You can download bulk notices or use the API to select data. 

You can find the data [here](https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/NoticeDownload/Download.aspx)

Similarly, you can search the contracts register [on this page](https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/Contracts/Contracts_Search.aspx?AuthID=AA10482). Each is OGL licensed. 

## Scottish Government Executive Agencies
I tried various ways to find a list of Executive Agencies on the Scottish Goverment website without success. I did find pages such as this [guide](https://www.gov.scot/publications/public-bodies-in-scotland-guide/) which had no list. Therefore, turning to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_agencies_of_the_Scottish_Government) I find a list of ten executive agencies (one more than last year). Thanks to Wikipedia's view history feature (why don't public sector websites show their changes!?) [I can see](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_agencies_of_the_Scottish_Government&diff=910495231&oldid=890467635)] that two new agencies were added: Forestry and Land Scotland, Scottish Forestry, and that Historic Environment Scotland has been removed, and made a NDPB (see below). 

Where the items in the list below are starred, it indicates that they were previosuly found to have some or all of their open data on the Statistics portal, above. Otherwise, unless flagged below using their initials, I have found no open data for them.

- Accountant in Bankruptcy __*__
- Disclosure Scotland
- Education Scotland (__ES__)
- Forestry and Land Scotland (__FLS__)
- Scottish Forestry (__SF__)
- Scottish Prison Service (__SPS__)
- Scottish Public Pensions Agency
- Social Security Scotland (__SSS__)
- Student Awards Agency for Scotland
- Transport Scotland

ES - In their [June 2019 Digital Strategy](https://education.gov.scot/Documents/ESDigitalStrategyJune2019.pdf) at Principle 5 says "...Education Scotland’s digital services must: Publish open data where possible to foster innovation in Scottish education...." But further than that I couldn't find specific actions or timescale in relation to open data, nor could I locate any data published since the strategy.

FLS - Querying the FLS site for 'Open Data' [was not at all helpful](https://forestryandland.gov.scot/search-results?q=open+data). The second result for Wildfire Prevention said that access to it was forbidden. So why list it in public search results?  

The first result was for "Energy Offering 2019" (whatever that means) and the final line of that page linked to a specific resource on an [Arc GIS site](http://data-forestry.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c31ae81655fb4c279a5d97b39065d63b_0/data) offering 10 boundary shapefiles. I found that navigating back to the home of that GIS site (actually a UK-wide Forestry Commission site) then allowed me to locate [19 resources for Scotland](http://data-forestry.opendata.arcgis.com/search?tags=Scotland). I checked a few. Some had an OGL licence. Others had a 'Custom Licence' such as 'There are no public access constraints to this data. Use of this data is subject to the Open Government LicenceAny maps produced using this data should contain the following Forestry Commission acknowledgement: "Contains, or is based on, information supplied by the Forestry Commission. © Crown copyright and database right 2019 Ordnance Survey [100021242]'.

SF - this has an [ARC GIS respoitory](https://open-data-scottishforestry.hub.arcgis.com/search?collection=Dataset)
with an impressive 71 sets of very intersting data. The several that I looked at were marked as having a "Custom Licence" but on clicking each they stated "In using the data from this website you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the Open Government Licence 3.0." No link was provided to the OGL3 to explain its terms, though. They also have a clear, but slightly dated Open Data plan. 

SPS - I was able to find a single dataset, an organogram, from 2010 [on the Data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/search?filters%5Bpublisher%5D=Scottish+Prison+Service) portal. Nothing else.

The Scottish Public Pensions Agency [states](https://pensions.gov.scot/freedom-information) "Please note that SPPA ... currently does not publish any open data." At least they are clear unlike Transport Scotland, below. 

SSS - Their publication scheme states that 5 star open data is published on the main government statistics data portal (above). Searching there for "Social Security" [does turn up five data sets](https://statistics.gov.scot/data/search?search=%22Social+Security+Scotland%22) but these are labelled as emanating from SG as a whole rather than from this agency. 

The Student Awards Agency has a [site](https://saas.gov.uk) whose footer on the front page uses fonts in a way that must be a crime against design. With some trawling it yielded a link to a 2012-2013 statistical publication, but no open data.

Transport Scotland's [publication scheme](https://www.transport.gov.scot/freedom-of-information/publication-scheme/#section-61318) says of open data "Open data made available by the authority as described by the Scottish Government’s Open Data Strategy and Resource Pack, available under an open licence. We comply with the guidance above when publishing data and other information to our website. Details of publications and statistics can be found in the body of this document or on the Publications section of our website." I searched both without success for any OD. _Why not say "we don't publish any Open Data"_? Also, compare this with the [Open Bus Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bus-open-data-service) for England. Story [here] (https://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/news/launch-bus-open-data-service-early-2020).

To be moved to NDPBs

- Historic Environment Scotland __HES__
__HES__ the HES [spatial portal](https://portal.historicenvironment.scot/spatialdownloads) has loads of data but no open licence. 

Also, I was alerted to the [Environment Scotland portal](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/useful-data-sources/) where they have links to other data sources many of which are open, as well as other useful content.
