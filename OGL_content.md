# Permission to re-use local authority website content
I have revisited the survey I conducted in Feb 2019. There is no significant shift in position from most councils. 

## Update August 2020

The table below shows the current permissions to reuse the content of Scottish Local Authorities' websites. Many are lacking in clarity, have messy wording, are vague or misunderstand terminologies. They also, in the main, ignore legislation on fair re-use. 

### Open Government Licence

The Scottish Government's [own site](https://gov.scot) is excellent and clear: [permitting](https://www.gov.scot/crown-copyright/) all content except logos to be be reused under the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/). At present only Falkirk and Orkney Councils - two of the smaller ones - allow, and promote OGL re-use. There is no good reason why all of the public sector, including local government, should not adopt the terms of OGL. 

### Re-use of Public Sector Information (RPSI) Regulations
Since 2015 the public sector has been obliged by the [RPSI Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1415/contents/made) to permit reasonable reuse of information held by local authorities. So, even if Scottish LAs have not yet adopted OGL for all website content, they should make it clear how a citizen can re-use their data and information from their website. In my latest trawl through the T&Cs and Copyright Statements of 32 Scottish Local Authorities, I found only 7 refrencing RPSI rights there, with 25 not doing so (see the expanded table below). I am fairly sure that these authorities are breaking the legal obligation on public bodies to provide that information.
