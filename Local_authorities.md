# Scottish Local Authorities Open Data List

## News
Reviewed February 2020 and rechecked Aug 2020. 

Sadly there is no significant change here in the year since I last reviewed the data provision by councils. The big gain is that [Renrewshire Council](http://data-ren.opendata.arcgis.com/search) have launched a new data portal with over fifty datasets. Most councils have had little or no change. Sadly the Highland Council [portal] (https://data.highland.gov.uk/dataset), procured as part of the Scottish Cities Alliance's Data Cluster programme, has vanished. I dont think it ever saw a dataset being added to it. Searching Highland Council's website for open data finds nothing. More than a third of councils (13 out of a total of 32) still make no open data provision. 

Given the presence of [COSLA](https://www.cosla.gov.uk/) on the Open Government Scotland steering group, this situation needs to be raised there. 

## The Data
A list of open data resources in the Scottish local government. 

Data is broken into three types - using APIs, open data, and linked open data.

| Key     | Definition |
| :------ |:-----------| 
|A|API|
|L|Linked Open Data|
|O|Open Data|

------

Data provided by the 32 Local Authorities. The data provision falls into three formats: portal, landing page and GIS-only data. 

Change (+/-) in number of datasets published is measured since Feb 2019. 

### Open Data Portals

The following councils have open data portals - most, if not all, CKAN.
