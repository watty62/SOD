# Scottish Local Authorities Open Data List

## News
Reviewed February 2020 and rechecked Aug 2020. 

Sadly there is no significant change here in the year since I last reviewed the data provision by councils. The big gain is that [Renrewshire Council](http://data-ren.opendata.arcgis.com/search) have launched a new data portal with over fifty datasets. Most councils have had little or no change. Sadly the Highland Council [portal](https://data.highland.gov.uk/dataset), procured as part of the Scottish Cities Alliance's Data Cluster programme, has vanished. I dont think it ever saw a dataset being added to it. Searching Highland Council's website for open data finds nothing. More than a third of councils (13 out of a total of 32) still make no open data provision. 

Given the presence of [COSLA](https://www.cosla.gov.uk/) on the Open Government Scotland steering group, this situation needs to be raised there. 

## The Data
A list of open data resources in the Scottish local government. 

Data is broken into three types - using APIs, open data, and linked open data.

| Key     | Definition |
| :------ |:-----------| 
|A|API|
|L|Linked Open Data|
|O|Open Data|

------

Data provided by the 32 Local Authorities. The data provision falls into three formats: portal, landing page and GIS-only data. 

Change (+/-) in number of datasets published is measured since Feb 2019. 

### Open Data Portals

The following councils have open data portals - most, if not all, CKAN.

### Using GIS only

These councils only expose geographical open data using their GIS systems. 

| Council       | URL         | Status| Datasets | Change|Type|
| :------------- |:-------------| :-----|:------|:----|:----:|
|Argyll and Bute Council|[URL](https://data-argyll-bute.opendata.arcgis.com/) |![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)|33|+2|O|
|Renfrewshire Council|[URL](http://data-ren.opendata.arcgis.com/search)|![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)|54|+54|O|

### None of the above
The following authorities still have no open data provision that I can find. 

- East Dunbartonshire Council
- East Lothian Council
- Falkirk Council
- Fife Council
- Highland Council
- Inverclyde Council (*)
- Midlothian Council
- Orkney Islands Council
- Scottish Borders Council
- South Lanarkshire Council
- West Dunbartonshire Council
- Western Isles Council (Comhairle nan Eilean Siar)
- West Lothian Council

(*) Despite Inverclyde publishing an [update](https://www.inverclyde.gov.uk/meetings/documents/12041/Policy%20&%20Resources%20PUBLIC.pdf) in March 2019 (Page 3 of Appendix 1) saying that its implementation of an Open Data strategy is 'Complete' I could find no open data anywhere.

## Reuse of website content
The lack of open data is a major obstacle to innovation and gets in the way of social and economic benefits that OD should deliver. Without well formatted and licenced open data it is necessary to scrape content from websites. This can only be done when the website owners allow it through clear terms of use and licensing. While the Scottish Government permit content re-use, 30 of 32 local authorities do not. I've have updated a survey of the [use of OGL licensing](OGL_content.md) by Scottish Local Authorities. It also shows a lack of adherence to ROPSI legislation too.
