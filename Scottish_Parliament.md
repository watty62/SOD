# Scottish Parliament
One year ago (Feb 2019) I found that The Scottish Parliament, had released 121 data sets. This covers motions, petitions, Bills, petitions and other procedural data, and is very interesting.

##News 2020

This year we find that they have still 121 data sets. So, no new data sources. In fact that number is misleading. 

While 75 of these have been updated with new data, the remaining 46 (marked BETA) no longer work. Why not fix them, or at worst clear them out to simplfy the finadbility of working data? 

Some of these BETA datasets should contain potentially more interesting / useful data e.g. *Register of Members Interests* but just don't work. Returning: 
`["{message: 'Data is presently unavailable'}"]`

I didn't note the availability of APIs last year, but there are 186 API calls available. Many of these are year-specific. I tested half a dozen and about a third of those returned error messages. I suspect some of these align with the non-functioning historic BETAs. 

Sadly the issues raised a year ago about the lack of clarity of the licensing of the data is unchanged. To find the licence, you have to go to Notes > Policy on Use of SPCB Copyright Material. Following the first link there (to a PDF) you see that you have to add "Contains information licenced under the Scottish Parliament Copyright Licence." to anything you make with it, which is OK. But if you go to the second link "Scottish Parliament Copyright Licence" (another PDF) the wording (slightly) contradicts that obligation. It then has a chunk about OGL but says, "This Scottish Parliament Licence is aligned with OGLv3.0" whatever that means. Why not just license all of the data under OGL? I can't see what they are trying to do.

As noted in 2019, Bob Taylor has created some captivating visualisations with this data [here](https://github.com/jakeybob/opendata-gganimate-test) which should suggest some interesting uses for the data.
